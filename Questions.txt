How many watts is a lot?
- Looks like the whole system uses ~19W so the microwatts that the pressure sensor uses seems negligable.

BMP280 documentation says it has a max altitude of ~9 km or 29k ft, but launch_code assumes that the pressure sensor
can detect an altitude as high as 65k ft (this is when the doors close). This seems to be outside the capabilities
of the sensor. Has this been considered/will it be good enough? (link to possible replacement: https://www.adafruit.com/product/4716?gclid=Cj0KCQjwkIGKBhCxARIsAINMioLxCG5gW1MJGmAY4mNTwlYjjfmYmf2MMZr3mJRjbql-tVTRVPAyLlcaAj18EALw_wcB)
